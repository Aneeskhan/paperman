MaxView
=======

For some years now I have been merrily scanning paper into PaperPort
and then throwing it away. PaperPort was a great piece of software
that made this relatively easy. I assumed that PaperPort would always
be available on my platform of choice.

Unfortunately, I got sick of Windows falling over and moved to Linux a
few years ago. PaperPort wasn't available for Linux, so I lost easy
access to this paper, and had to reboot to Windows to use it.

MaxView aims to provide a facility to view PaperPort (.max) files in a
Linux environment, or in fact any other QT-supported platform such as
Unix and Mac.

If anyone from ScanSoft is listening, please take pity on your poor
Mac and Linux users, we are humans too.

The software has been ported to the Mac, but the diffs are not included
here. I will get into this once I can get my son's Mac Mini to play ball.


Features
--------

Before you try it, here's what to look for:

- fairly primitive GUI, inspired by PaperPort
- navigate through directories
- view previews and browse through pages
- double click to view full size page image
- simple print option

new in 0.4:
- basic scanning
- partial creation of .max files (but monochrome images are uncompressed)
       (also it doesn't create greyscale/colour previews)


new in 0.5:
- better scanning, should now work properly with SANE and most scanners
- stacking/unstacking, moving files between directories, etc.
- colour previews are created (greyscale still not sorry)
- PDF, JPEG and TIFF conversion supported. Results may vary
- View quality menu to trade speed for quality


new in 0.7:
- better multithreaded scanning
- undo/redo
- better PDF support
- preview panes
- OCR engine
- zooming in and out in preview windows (hold down control and use mouse wheel)
- rewritten for QT4
- many many other changes and improvements



Future Features
---------------

Here's what I'd like it to support:

- more operations on images
- support for more image types



Building
--------

You will need these packages:

- libqt4-dev

QT4.4 is needed. This is quite a new version. You may need to enable
backports to get it on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) for example.

- libpoppler-qt4-dev

This is used for PDF rendering

- podofo

This is embedded within the code. It should build automatically when you
type 'qmake', but if not, try 'make podofo'

- libsane-dev

This is the sane scanner library.

- libtiff4-dev

This is the tiff library

- cmake

This is needed to build podofo



To prepare on Debian or Ubuntu:

   sudo apt-get install qtcreator g++ qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libpoppler-qt4-dev libsane-dev libtiff4-dev cmake

For Red Hat / Centos you will try some other approach.


To build:

   qmake maxview.pro
   make

You may get an error 'WARNING: Failure to find: /usr/share/qtcreator/gdbmacros/gdbmacros.cpp'. You
can install qtcreator if you like to remove this warning.


But if you have QT3 installed:

$ qmake -v
Qmake version: 1.07a (Qt 3.3.8b)
Qmake is free software from Trolltech ASA.


then you will need to force QT4:

   qmake-qt4
   make


Nuance Omnipage
---------------

There is the beginnings of support for this excellent commercial OCR library.
To use this you will need to purchase a license which will cost several
hundred US$. Please contact me if you are interested in this and I will see
what I can arrange.

To use this support, see config.h and you will need to install the license
file.



If you have other ideas then feel free to let me know...
